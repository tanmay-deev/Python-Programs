Tuple is a collection similar to a list that is you can store any type of data.
The basics difference between tuple and a lsit is that we can not modify a tuple once it is created.

To create a tuple we use Rounded Bracket ().

Tuples are--
1. Tuples are orderded that is they mantain the order of the elements
2. Innutable that is they cannot been changed after creation
3. Allows duplicates that is they can store duplicate values 

To access any elements from the tuple we use a number called as index starting with zero
