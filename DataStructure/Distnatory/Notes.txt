It is a collection of elements Similar to list and tuple however unlike list and tuple each element in distonary is a key value pare Enclosed in { }.

For ex -- { 1 : "one"}

distonary keys must be immutable such as integer, string etc. We cannot use changable or mutable objects such as list as keys.

We can also create a distonary by using built in function dict() 

A dictonary an ordered collection that is to access the element from the dictonary we can place the keys inside the Square bracket ex -- dict = {1 : "one",}
