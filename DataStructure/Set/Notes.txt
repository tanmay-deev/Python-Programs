A set is a collection of unique data that is the elements within a set cannot be duplicateded 

In python to create a set we use {} curly brackets 

A set can store different types of elemtnts like integer, float, tuple, string etc.But it cannot store Mutable elements like list, dictonary etc. 

The set dose't have a particular order 

different type of built in method can be used to perform set oprations like union, intersection, simitric difference, ect. 

we can also check wether tow sets are equal or not using (==) operator
