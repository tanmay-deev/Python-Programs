A string is a        to represet a string we use '' or "".

WE can access characteres in a string by using first indexing (Positive and negative Indexing) Similar to a list.

Slicing -- That is access a range of characteres by using Colon : as a slicing operator.

If we try to access an index out of the range or use numbers other than an integer then we will get errors.

In python strings are immutable that is the characters of a string cannot be changed.

String Operations --

2. Join two or more strings - we can join (concanitate) two or more strings by using (+) plus operator
