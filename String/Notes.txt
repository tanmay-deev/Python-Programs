A string is a        to represet a string we use '' or "".

WE can access characteres in a string by using first indexing (Positive and negative Indexing) Similar to a list.

Slicing -- That is access a range of characteres by using Colon : as a slicing operator.

If we try to access an index out of the range or use numbers other than an integer then we will get errors.

In python strings are immutable that is the characters of a string cannot be changed.

String Operations --
1. Compare two strings we use (==) double equal to operator two compare two strings if the two strings are equal the operator returns true otherwise it returns false 

2. Join two or more strings - we can join (concanitate) two or more strings by using (+) plus operator

To find the length of the string we can use built in method len()

String membership Test -- we can test if a substring exist within a string or not using keyword (in) (not in)

split() --      Description - It splits the string from the left 
startswith() -- Description - it checks if string start with the specified string
index() --      Description - It returns index of substring
isnumeric() --  Description - It checks numeric characteres
